Project Overview 
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter using MATLAB and Verilog. The project includes generating a noisy sine wave in MATLAB, converting it to integer and binary formats, and processing it through a custom FIR filter designed in Verilog. The project also includes a testbench for simulation purposes.

Introduction

This project provides a comprehensive approach to FIR filter design and signal processing. The MATLAB script generates a noisy sine wave, scales it, and converts it to a binary format, which is then used as input for the Verilog FIR filter implementation.

Prerequisites

MATLAB: R2021b or later Vivado: For Verilog simulation and synthesis Basic knowledge of signal processing and FIR filters

MATLAB Implementation

The MATLAB script performs the following tasks:

Generation of a Sine Wave: A 1-cycle sine wave is generated with a specified frequency.

Addition of Noise: Random noise is added to the sine wave to simulate a noisy signal.

Normalization: The noisy signal is normalized to ensure values lie between -1 and 1.

Conversion to Integer Format: The normalized signal is scaled and converted to an integer format suitable for digital processing.

Binary Conversion: The integer values are converted to binary format and saved to a text file (signal.data), which serves as input for the Verilog code.

Verilog Implementation

The Verilog code implements a custom FIR filter, which processes the binary input data generated by the MATLAB script. The design includes:

Delay Line: Implemented using D flip-flops to store previous input values. Multiplication: The delayed inputs are multiplied by predefined filter coefficients. Summation: The products are summed to generate the filtered output. Testbench: A testbench is provided to simulate the FIR filter with the input data.

Usage

MATLAB: Run the MATLAB script to generate the noisy sine wave and its binary representation. Verilog: Use the generated signal.data file as input to your Verilog simulation. Run the testbench to simulate the FIR filter.

Results

The results include filtered signal outputs, which can be visualized and compared with the original noisy input to evaluate the performance of the FIR filter.
